  <h2>About the Sloppy Joe</h2>
  <p>
    The Sloppy Joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef and onions in a tomato-based sauce 
    served on a hamburger bun. The sandwich likely originated in <strong>Sioux City, Iowa</strong> 
    in the 1930s. According to legend, the "loose meat sandwich" was the creation of a cook named Joe.

    Making the Sloppy Joe is not as sloppy as you think. It takes 5 minutes to prepare, 30
    minutes to cook, and you can serve 6 sandwiches!

  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 quart canola oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>2 (4.23-oz) packages Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese Bites</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven. Heat
      oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
      While oil heats, set out 3 wide shallow bowls. Fill
      them individually with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Working with a handful of bites at a time, gently dredge cheese in
      flour, and shake off excess. Dip in eggs; let excess drip off. Dredge
      in breadcrumbs to coat. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet or large
      plate. Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fry boursin bites in batches, cooking until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
      Set on paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bites. Transfer
      to a platter and serve immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>

This project will create a website that displays recipes!

What I learned:
- I learned how hungry I can get whenever I learn something through food.
- I learned how to build the boilerplate with the additional "<meta>" line
- I learned how to structure my pages using header tags
- I learned how to add images 
- I learned how to make the UX a bit better by letting them go back to Odin Recipes
- I learned about the &apos; which is for apostrophes
